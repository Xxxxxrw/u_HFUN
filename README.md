# u-HFUN

This is an official implementation of the paper “u-HFUN: Ultra-Lightweight Network with Hierarchical Feature Upsampler for Single Image Super-Resolution”.

## Dependencies

- The cuda version used in the project is 12.2
- Python = 3.8 (Recommend to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux))
```
conda create -n your_env_name python=3.8
conda activate your_env_name
```
- Other packages required by the project are in the file ‘requirements.txt’
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Model framework 
1. The network model implementation code (6 blocks and 10 blocks) is located in directory `./src/model/`
2. Network model diagram：

# Codes 
- This codes provide the testing and training code.
  
## How to Test
1. Download the five test datasets (Set5, Set14, B100, Urban100, Manga109) from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lsoyAjsUEyp7gm1t6vZI9j7jr9YzKzcF?usp=sharing)

2. All versions of pretrained models have be placed in `./pre_models/` folder. 

3. The testing commands are placed in the './src/demo.sh' file. 
Close comments in 'demo.sh' and run 'demo.sh' to execute the corresponding command of testing. Such as:
```
python main.py --model u_hfun --save ./test/u_HFUN_Div2k_tiny_x2 --scale 2 --n_feats 32 --pre_train /Your_Path/u_HFUN/pretrained/../ --data_test Set5+Set14+B100+Urban100+Manga109 --test_only
```

4. More testing commonds can be found in `./src/demo.sh` file and the output results will be sorted in `./experiment/test/`

## How to Train

1. Download [DIV2K](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/DIV2K/) from [Here](https://cv.snu.ac.kr/research/EDSR/DIV2K.tar) 

3. Modify the training dataset path attributes '--dir_data' and '--data_train' in the `./src/option.py` file.

4. The training commands are placed in the './src/demo.sh' file.
Close comments in 'demo.sh' and run 'demo.sh' to execute the corresponding command of training. Such as:
```
python main.py --model u_hfun --save ./train/u_HFUN_Div2k_x2 --scale 2 --lr 6e-4 --batch_size 32 --patch_size 128 --n_feats 32 --decay 200-400-600-800 --data_test Set5 --reset --epoch=1000
```
4. More training commond can be found in `./src/demo.sh` file, and the training results will be sorted in `./experiment/train/`

## SR images visualization
1. We provided visualization of SR images for two versions of the model ( HIGAN and HIGAN-L) from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xiPOE22AExEcIe5-er3clOYFHCVCJo6F?usp=sharing) or [Baidu Drive](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1vEOJaLGScgRGaIOeFI3q8w) (code：s8eg)
2. Visual comparison of reconstructions in the paper（HIGAN）:
